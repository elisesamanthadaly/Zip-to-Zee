# Zip-to-Zee
Mass conversion of zip codes to zee codes made easy

To use, open "zip to zee.html" in a web browser, then copy/paste a column of zip codes from an Excel table into the form. Hit "Submit" to have a column of zee codes placed into your clipboard, ready to be pasted back into your spreadsheet.

Copy/paste on submit function taken from Niente0's post [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26053004/copy-whole-html-table-to-clipboard-javascript).

Switch statement in "zip to zee.html" generated using "zip to zee.html - data generation." The original zip to zee reference document was a two-column table containing 44822 rows that I did not want to encode by hand.

Future plans: a similar script for conversion of columns with "First Name+Last Name" cells to two adjacent columns ("First Name / Last Name").
